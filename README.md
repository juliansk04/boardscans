# boardscans
A repository of scanned PCBs utilized for teardown and hardware research, largely related to console hardware. The broader purpose is to preserve board data to aid in future repair and servicing.

Note: Some board scans come from destroyed PCBs so they may have missing pads.



## 🤝 Board Donations & High-Resolution Scanning

I accept board donations for high-resolution archival scanning and technical documentation.
If you need your PCB scanned, documented, and archived using the same preservation workflow, 
feel free to reach out.
All scans are intended for hardware preservation, reverse engineering research, 
and future repair reference.



### 🙌 Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Hugo (www.supergusiland.com) for contributing the GBA SP AGS-CPU-30 board for archival scanning and documentation.
